# Tabular Weather Prediction

## Task

Predict the output temperature given a set of weather features.

## Getting Started

`tutorial.ipynb` provides an example of how to impelement a baseline using the method from [Uncertainty Estimation in Gradient Boosting via Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.10562.pdf). It walks through the following steps:
1. Repository download
2. Data download
3. Data loading
4. Training & Saving
5. Model loading
6. Evaluation & Inference
7. Submission
